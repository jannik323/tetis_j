# tetis_j
this is my self made tetris clone that im working on as a project to learn javascript. so far its been going pretty well.


last thing i added is turning the "units" as i call it. I didnt add any useful comments , so reading it could be harder bcs of that. 
also im fairly new to js html and co ... so dont destroy me because i did x wrong and didnt do y. thx thx

next thing i wanna add is detection for slamming into walls sideways ( it only checks when something is below a piece for now)

and a way to actually clear lines lol.
